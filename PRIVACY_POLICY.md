# VocAd Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 14, 2025

## Overview

VocAd ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our vocabulary learning application.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.**

VocAd is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- ✅ **No Account Required** - You don't need to create an account or provide any personal information
- ✅ **No Data Collection** - We don't collect any usage data, analytics, or telemetry
- ✅ **No Tracking** - We don't use cookies, tracking pixels, or any tracking mechanisms
- ✅ **No Third-Party Services** - We don't integrate analytics services or advertising networks
- ✅ **No Data Transmission** - Your vocabulary data never leaves your device

## Data Storage

All vocabulary data, learning progress, and app settings are stored **locally on your device only** using:
- Apple's Core Data framework
- Standard iOS UserDefaults

This data is:
- Stored in your device's private app sandbox
- Never transmitted to any server
- Never shared with third parties
- Automatically deleted when you uninstall the app

## Optional Features

### Web Search (Optional)
When you choose to use the vocabulary search feature, the app may connect to:
- dictionaryapi.dev (for word definitions)
- datamuse.com (for word suggestions)
- mymemory.translated.net (for translations)

These connections:
- Are **user-initiated only** (you must tap the search button)
- Only send the specific word you're searching for
- Don't include any personal information
- Can be completely avoided by not using the search feature

### Photos Access (Optional)
The app may request permission to save flashcard images to your Photos library. This:
- Is **completely optional**
- Only occurs when you explicitly tap "Save Image"
- Only saves images you choose
- Doesn't access or read any existing photos

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no security risks related to data breaches or unauthorized access to our servers (because we don't have any servers).

Your vocabulary data is protected by:
- iOS sandboxing (apps can't access each other's data)
- Device encryption (if you have device passcode/biometric enabled)
- Your device's security features

## Children's Privacy

VocAd does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages.

## Data Portability

You have complete control over your vocabulary data:
- **Export**: You can export all your vocabulary to CSV or JSON format at any time
- **Import**: You can import vocabulary from other apps
- **Delete**: Uninstalling the app removes all data from your device

## Third-Party Links

The app may contain links to external websites (e.g., when searching for word definitions). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be noted in the app's "What's New" section.

## Your Rights

All your data is already on your device, under your control.
